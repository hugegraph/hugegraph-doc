# HugeGraph documentation contribution guide

For the short workflow, start with [README.md](./README.md). This file records the production-equivalent checks for changes to the documentation website.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Build the site with the strict production command and keep the complete exit status.
- [ ] Update both `content/en/` and `content/cn/` when the change applies to both languages.
- [ ] Include before/after screenshots for visual or navigation changes.
- [ ] Preserve public English routes under `/docs/...` and Chinese routes under `/cn/docs/...`.
- [ ] Link the related issue when one exists.

## Pinned toolchain

The site uses the Hugo Module recorded in `go.mod` and `go.sum`:

Toolchain versions are maintained in `go.mod` and `.github/workflows/hugo.yml`;
`go.mod` / `go.sum` pin the theme. Node.js is needed only for the browser tests,
with its version declared by `tests/e2e/package.json` and CI.

Verify the installed toolchain and locked module:

```bash
hugo version
go version
python3 scripts/oink_module.py
```

For theme updates and breaking-change recovery, follow
[scripts/oink-upgrade.md](scripts/oink-upgrade.md).

For Kapa staging, consent/CSP checks and production activation, follow
[scripts/kapa-rollout.md](scripts/kapa-rollout.md).

## Local preview

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/hugegraph-doc.git
cd hugegraph-doc
scripts/hugo.sh server
```

Open <http://localhost:1313/>. The local preview includes the language-aware search index so search behavior can be checked before publication.

## Strict production build

Run the same warning-strict build used by CI:

```bash
scripts/hugo.sh build
```

The wrapper derives the complete version menu from `versions.json` before
starting Hugo. Additional Hugo arguments are passed through unchanged, for
example `scripts/hugo.sh server -p 8080`. Set `HG_DOC_VERSION`,
`HG_DOC_SITE_ORIGIN`, or `HG_DOC_HISTORICAL_ORIGIN` only when validating a
specific version or publication origin.

The wrapper applies Hugo's configuration, environment, strict-warning,
cleanup, and minification flags before your arguments; Hugo's last-wins flag
handling means anything you append (for example `--logLevel debug`) takes
effect. Use `--baseURL` or `HG_DOC_SITE_ORIGIN` when changing the rendered
origin (the flag wins when both are set); a server `--port` is reflected in
the generated local origin.

A successful command proves that Hugo rendered the configured outputs. It does not replace browser checks for navigation, search, language switching, accessibility, mobile layout, print, or Content Security Policy behavior.

## CI queue and reruns

Each PR has its own concurrency group; a new commit cancels its previous run.
Cancelled runs skip report uploads and the final gate instead of holding the
queue with `always()`. A queued job with no runner has not started testing;
repeated reruns do not resolve runner capacity shortages.

A complete historical cache hit uses one build job. Cold runs use at most three
build groups, with at most two versions building concurrently within each runner.
Historical artifacts are reused only when both the complete build-input fingerprint
and artifact digest match. Missing or invalid cache entries rebuild automatically;
manual dispatches start without the artifact cache and use the original build and
validate commands so older candidate branches do not need the new CI helpers. Cache hits still run the full
version validator, and aggregation validates every selected version again.

Assembly validates at most two versions concurrently, then writes the complete
site and runs the cross-version checks. The final security scan also uses at most
two processes; it starts after version validation finishes, so these pools do not
nest. All checks remain enabled. Stage timings are printed as
`timing <stage>: <seconds>s`; nested security timings are included in their parent
validation duration and must not be added twice. Site assembly and blocking browser
tests share one runner and the same local artifact. The assembly job carries the
required `deploy` check name, avoiding a separate gate runner and its queue time.
Its first step requires successful preparation and builds, and all assembly and
browser checks remain blocking. Visual captures remain advisory and publication
alone receives write permission. For a test failure, rerun failed
jobs after inspecting the cause; artifact names remain stable within the run.

## SeaTunnel documentation versions

The `latest` SeaTunnel guides use the 3.0+ minimum-version label and link to
upstream latest/Next documentation. Concrete versions in installation commands are
examples, with the engine and plugins kept at the same version. When preparing the
HugeGraph 1.8.0 documentation snapshot, pin its SeaTunnel references and installation
version to 3.0.0 in the release branch; keep the `latest` guides tracking upstream.

latest 文档使用 SeaTunnel 3.0+ 等最低版本说明，并引用上游 latest/Next 文档；安装命令中的具体版本仅作为示例，引擎和插件保持同版。
准备 HugeGraph 1.8.0 文档快照时，在发布分支中将 SeaTunnel 文档引用和安装版本固定为 3.0.0，latest 文档继续跟随上游。

## Repository structure

- `content/en/` and `content/cn/` contain the bilingual source pages.
- `hugo.yaml` owns routing, languages, outputs, search, navigation, and OINK parameters.
- `data/home/<language>.yaml` owns the bilingual homepage.
- `data/footer/<language>.yaml` owns the bilingual footer.
- `i18n/zh-CN.yaml` carries only HugeGraph-specific Simplified Chinese labels; generic interface translations come from OINK for the preserved `cn` URL language key; the file is named after the `zh-CN` locale because Hugo resolves translations by locale, not by the URL key.
- `assets/` and `static/` contain site-owned brand and compatibility assets.

OINK is a module dependency. Do not copy or edit generated module-cache files. Site-specific overrides belong in the corresponding root `layouts/`, `assets/`, or data path and require focused regression evidence.
