This guide covers the differences between HStore + PD and standalone RocksDB.
For modeling, importing data, and querying, see the [Hubble standalone guide](/docs/quickstart/toolchain/hugegraph-hubble/).
This guide follows Toolchain `master`.

The main repository's [docker/docker-compose-hstore.yml](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/blob/master/docker/docker-compose-hstore.yml)
already combines PD, Store, Server, and Hubble. Follow the adjacent
[Docker README](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/blob/master/docker/README.md) to prepare `.env` and generated Hubble local configuration,
then start it from `docker/`; do not maintain another deployment YAML.
The settings below explain connection differences and do not replace the README's PD credential and service-readiness requirements.

The screenshots use Hubble built from Toolchain `1.8.0` with Server, PD, and Store `1.7.0`. Hubble currently returns the static value `3.0.0`
from `/about`, which does not identify its build version. This pairing describes the screenshot environment; `latest` is mutable.
Metrics and permission APIs vary by version.

## Connect to a distributed cluster

Hubble still manages graph data through the **Server graph API**. In distributed mode, it discovers Servers through PD
and collects cluster information from PD and Store. Hubble does not read or write graph data directly in Store.

For the official Compose deployment, prepare `.env` in the main repository's `docker/` directory following its README, then generate the Hubble configuration:

```bash
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
./set-hubble-pd-password.sh hstore
```

The script reads the loaded `HG_PD_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` and writes the PD operations password to the host file
`docker/conf/hubble/hstore.local.properties`. Edit this generated file to customize connection or operations settings, preserving
`operations.pd.password` so it matches PD's secret. Do not replace it with the tracked `.example` template. Compose mounts it read-only at
`/hubble/conf/hugegraph-hubble.properties` inside the container; do not edit it there. Do not commit the generated file or `.env`.
Running the script again overwrites the generated file, so reapply custom settings afterward.

Start the services from the same `docker/` directory and confirm Server registration and Store readiness:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-hstore.yml up -d --wait
```

For separately deployed services, follow the [PD deployment guide](/docs/quickstart/hugegraph/hugegraph-pd/) and
[HStore deployment guide](/docs/quickstart/hugegraph/hugegraph-hstore/). A source or binary Hubble deployment instead uses the package's
`conf/hugegraph-hubble.properties`. These settings match the official minimal topology; use backend-reachable addresses for other deployments:

```properties
pd.enabled=true
cluster=hg
pd.peers=pd:8686
pd.server=pd:8620
```

| Setting | Purpose | Bundled value |
|---|---|---|
| `pd.enabled` | Explicitly enable PD mode; `server.direct_url` is not used in this mode. | `false` |
| `cluster` | Cluster name used for Server discovery; it must match the registration. | `hg` |
| `pd.peers` | PD **gRPC** addresses, separated by commas. | `127.0.0.1:8686` |
| `pd.server` | PD **REST** address for cluster operations, not a list of gRPC peers. | `127.0.0.1:8620` |

Do not interchange ports `8686` and `8620`, or retain `127.0.0.1` for connections between containers.
The bundled file explicitly sets `pd.enabled=false`, while the Java fallback for a missing key is `true`; set it explicitly in either deployment.
Restart source or binary Hubble deployments after configuration changes. For Compose, recreate the Hubble container from `docker/` after editing
or regenerating the host file so the read-only bind mount loads it again; retain the original project name and all `-f` arguments:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-hstore.yml up -d --force-recreate hubble
```

You do not enter a Server host and port for each graph in the UI.

## Organize graphs and permissions with GraphSpaces

A GraphSpace groups graphs, Schema templates, and access permissions. For example, create `sales` and `research` spaces
so each team can work with its own graphs. Modeling, importing, and querying within a space follow the standalone guide.

### Create and adjust a GraphSpace

With Server authentication enabled, creating, editing, and deleting GraphSpaces require super administrator access.
Start with a globally unique GraphSpace name, an optional display alias, and the maximum graph count.
For example, use `research` as the API identifier and “Research_graph” as the display alias.
The name cannot change after creation. The alias and description can change; aliases do not participate in URLs or permission matching.
Choose GraphSpace administrators from existing accounts.

“Advanced deployment and resource limits” includes CPU and memory limits for graph query/write services and asynchronous compute tasks,
plus the storage capacity limit. These are deployment and quota settings, not current usage or a promise to resize Docker containers when the form is saved.
Defaults are 100 graphs, 64 CPU cores and 128 GB of memory for each of the graph and compute services, and 1000000 GB of storage.
Keep the defaults for a container trial. Configure Kubernetes namespaces, Operator images, and algorithm images only for the corresponding deployment or
compute use.

Select a space before opening a graph. Check the current graph after switching spaces, especially when spaces contain identically named graphs.
The list reflects account access. If a space is missing, check membership permissions before creating more graphs.

### Reuse Schema templates

**User-defined Schema templates require PD mode** and persist reusable Groovy Schema within a GraphSpace.
When several business graphs share vertex labels, edge labels, and indexes, save the model as a template and select it when creating subsequent graphs.
For example, a user template in `research` can be reused for new graphs in that space. After switching spaces, select a template belonging to the new space.

User templates differ from the built-in sample templates in the main guide: built-in templates help explore preset models,
while user templates preserve your own models for future use. A template is not an import of data; loading sample data is a separate graph creation choice.
With Server authentication enabled, creating a user template requires write access to its space.
Updating or deleting it also requires ownership or the corresponding administrative permission.
Anonymous mode does not enforce per-user permissions or template ownership checks.
Standalone mode does not provide user template management.

## Assign access to a GraphSpace

For account creation, login, and personal details, see the [standalone guide](/docs/quickstart/toolchain/hugegraph-hubble/).
Distributed mode adds “Manage GraphSpace members” to assign permissions between existing accounts and selected spaces.
Servers supporting permission presets provide these common choices:

| Preset | Intended user | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| GraphSpace read-only | Users who inspect and query graph data | Selected spaces. |
| GraphSpace read-write | Users who model, import, and maintain graph data | Selected spaces. |
| GraphSpace administrator | Owners managing a space's members and graph resources | Selected spaces; does not grant GraphSpace creation/editing or cluster operations access. |
| Super administrator | Operators managing accounts, GraphSpaces, and the cluster | Global; assign according to responsibilities. |

An account may have different access in different spaces, such as read-write in `research` and read-only in `sales`.
Accounts and space memberships are managed separately; removing a member does not delete the global account.
After creating an account, continue directly to assigning space access. When changing an existing membership, check the selected space and preset
and preserve permissions still needed in other spaces. Enabling `pd.enabled` grants no permissions;
legacy custom roles on older Servers are not interchangeable with these presets.
See [Server authentication and authorization](/docs/config/config-authentication/).

## Locate problems through the cluster overview

The overview presents **Server → PD → Store** in one topology. Switch to the node list to filter by type, status, or name.
PD Leader, online Store count, graphs, partitions, replicas, and data size help identify cluster scale and nodes requiring attention.
Partitions and replicas describe data distribution. Data size is observed usage, distinct from a GraphSpace's configured storage limit.

Start with cluster and source status, then inspect an affected node. `UP` indicates a successful collection from the source;
`DEGRADED` indicates a cluster or partial source issue, and `DOWN` indicates that the corresponding probe failed.
Graphs may remain queryable when topology is available but some metrics are missing.
The UI distinguishes unsupported, unavailable, stale, and failed collections and includes observation times.
An empty value is not zero, and an older value is not a current observation.

![Cluster topology, node status, and capacity](/docs/images/hubble/cluster-overview.jpg)

### Read node details

| Node | Main observations | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Server | Availability, JVM/CPU/memory, and backend metrics | Check the query/write entrypoint and resource pressure. |
| PD | Leader/Follower role, status, and runtime metrics supplied upstream | Check the metadata/scheduling entrypoint; do not infer a role when Leader information is absent. |
| Store | Partition and Leader partition counts, system/disk metrics, Raft group and enabled group counts | Inspect storage nodes and replica service and compare distribution across nodes. |

![Store system, drive, Raft, and partition metrics](/docs/images/hubble/store-node.jpg)

The PD Leader and Store Leader partitions serve different purposes: PD coordinates cluster metadata, while a Store leads the respective data partition's Raft
group.
Hubble displays upstream observations and does not replace a full Raft replica consistency check. Available metrics vary by component version.

With Server authentication enabled, cluster operations require a super administrator (`ADMIN` level).
GraphSpace administrators and ordinary members do not inherit cluster access.
Use container isolation, a trusted HTTPS entrypoint, Server authentication, and network allowlists; avoid publishing Hubble or component ports directly.

### Configure operations access

Hubble's **backend** uses the PD/Store operations credentials, separately from the Server account used to log in through the browser.
For Compose, edit the generated host file `docker/conf/hubble/hstore.local.properties`; other deployments use the Hubble package configuration.
The script-generated PD password must match the secret in `.env`. Configure the Store service account when Store authentication is enabled.
Do not include passwords in documentation, screenshots, or committed configuration:

| Setting | Bundled default | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| `operations.pd.username` / `operations.pd.password` | Username `hubble`, empty password | Match PD operations REST authentication. |
| `operations.store.username` / `operations.store.password` | Username `hubble`, empty password | Set the service account when upstream Store REST authentication is enabled. |
| `operations.store.allowed_targets` | `[http://127.0.0.1:8520,http://[::1]:8520]` | List trusted Store metric origins. |

For example, when a containerized Store advertises `store:8520`, set:

```properties
operations.store.allowed_targets=[http://store:8520]
```

For multiple nodes, list each trusted origin. Every entry must use `http` or `https` with an explicit port and no path, credentials, or wildcard,
and must match the Store metric target returned by PD. Adding an origin to this list does not register or discover a node.

If topology is available but metrics are incomplete, check backend connectivity and authentication to PD REST, the Store REST/metric targets returned by PD,
and their match with the allowlist. A partially available overview means some sources could not be collected;
it does not imply that all graph APIs are unavailable.
